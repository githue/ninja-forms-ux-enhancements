User experience enhancements for the Ninja Forms 3 plugin.

== Description ==

### Let web browsers save submitted data

When a returning visitor uses one of your forms their browser will
offer to automatically fill in the rest of the form (or the current
field) using the same information they entered last time. This is
especially beneficial for people using a touch-screen device.

### Form layout

All the classes defined on a field's container element are moved to the true container, giving you more control of the form layout. Useful for responsive Bootstrap layouts.

### Submission date display

Display created and modified dates in standard international format when viewing/editing form submissions.

### Return to submissions list

Adds a button that takes you back to the submissions list on the submission edit page.

### Scrollbar visibility

Shows the scrollbar in the Ninja Forms dashboard.

== Screenshots ==

1. Easily style the form layout using CSS with the Form Layout option.
2. Return to the submissions list without depending on the back button.

== Configuration ==

Settings are found under Settings -> Ninja Forms UX.
