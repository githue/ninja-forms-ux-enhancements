User experience enhancements for the Ninja Forms 3 plugin.

== Description ==

Settings are found under Settings -> Ninja Forms UX.

## Options & Features

### 1. Let web browsers save submitted data

Ninja Forms doesn't add a submit listener to its forms so web browsers don't know when a Ninja Form has been submitted.
This option fixes that problem; when someone submits one of your forms all their data will be saved in their web
browser, this lets them use their browser's auto-fill feature. You can still specify fields that shouldn't be
remembered through the Ninja Forms builder.

### 3. Return to submissions list

Adds a button that takes you back to the submissions list on the submission edit page.

### 4. Scrollbar visibility

Shows the scrollbar in the Ninja Forms dashboard.
