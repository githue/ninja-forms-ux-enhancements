# UX Enhancements for Ninja Forms (Wordpress plugin)

User experience enhancements for Ninja Forms 3 for Wordpress.

## Options & Features

This unofficial plugin for Ninja Forms provides user experience
improvements for webmasters, designers and end-users.

Read on for the list of features.

### Let web browsers remember user input

When a returning visitor uses one of your forms their browser will
offer to automatically fill in the rest of the form (or the current
field) using the same information they entered last time. This is
especially useful for people using touch-screens.

*Intended for end-users*

### Form layout

All the classes defined on a field's container element are moved to the
true container `<nf-field>`, giving you more control over the form
layout. Useful for responsive Bootstrap layouts.

*Intended for CSS authors*

### Submission date display

Display created and modified dates in standard international format
when viewing/editing form submissions.

*Intended for webmasters*

### Return to submissions list

Adds a button that takes you back to the submissions list on the
submission edit page. Avoids unpredictable behavior with the back
button.

*Intended for webmasters*
