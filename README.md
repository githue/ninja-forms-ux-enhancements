# UX Enhancements for Ninja Forms (Wordpress plugin)

User experience enhancements for Ninja Forms 3 for Wordpress.

## Options & Features

This unofficial plugin for Ninja Forms provides user experience
improvements for admins, developers and end-users.

Read on for the list of features.

### Let web browser remember user input for auto-fill

When a returning visitor uses one of your forms their browser will
offer to automatically complete the rest of the form (or the current
field) using the same information they entered last time. This is
especially useful for people using touch-screens.

*Intended for end-users*

### Specify input mode for on-screen keyboards

Adds two new settings to text fields called "Input mode" and
"Pattern". This allows you to force virtual keyboards to open a
number pad by default.

### Form layout

All the classes defined on a field's container element are moved to the
true container `<nf-field>`, giving you more control over the form
layout. Useful for responsive Bootstrap layouts.

*Intended for developers*

### Submission date display

Display created and modified dates in standard international format
when viewing/editing form submissions.

*Intended for admins*

### Return to submissions list

Adds a button that takes you back to the submissions list on the
submission edit page. Avoids unpredictable behavior with the back
button.

*Intended for admins*

### Scrollbar visibility

Shows the scrollbar in the Ninja Forms dashboard.

*Intended for admins*
